		Multilib Rewrite

</div>

A Roblox library that allows you to perform *simple* task even *simplier*. See ->
[**Docs**](https://opkvysxct.github.io/Multilib-Rewrite/) for installation and usage help!

## Why Multilib exists?
I just found out that I use the same elements repeatedly across all my projects, and it became quite messy. So, I decided to develop a library that can manage these elements for me. The initial version was quite basic, to be honest, too basic. As a result, I made the decision to rewrite the entire library to include support for multiple modules and classes, among other things. This is why Multilib came into existence.
